            I'm Mariana and I'm studying Computer Science @ Georgia Tech. In my
            past internships and projects, I've taken on roles as a front-end
            developer and UX designer. I love exploring the intersection between
            development and design - from bringing wireframes alive to having
            fun with creative computing!

            My professional goal is to use my programming skills and technical
            knowledge to improve the access to quality education. At GT, I've
            been involved in clubs and initiatives to teach CS to students from
            underrepresented groups such as women and minorities. I also worked
            as a TA for the Girls Who Code Summer Immersion Program - one of the
            most fun and meaningful experiences I've had.
