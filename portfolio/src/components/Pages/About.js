            I'm Mariana and I'm studying Computer Science & HCI @ Georgia Tech.
            In my past internships and projects, I've taken on roles as a
            front-end developer and UX designer. I'm interested in the
            intersection between development and design and I love bringing
            wireframes to life!
          </p>
          <p>
            Since I'm graduating soon (this December 2020!), I'm currently
            looking for full-time roles as a UX engineer or a similar position.
            My professional goal is to use my programming skills and technical
            knowledge to improve the access to quality education.

            My biggest passion is a combination of traveling, learning
            languages, and discovering other cultures. I am a huge advocate for
            the benefits of travel - I've done a few exchanges in France{" "}

            In terms of personal development, I'm really excited to be learning
            data science! I'm starting an intensive data science program with
            Correlation One, and I can't wait to combine my software development
            background with predictive modeling to create great digital
            products!
